# Tandemloop Screening Test Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the Tandemloop screening test problems. The solutions are implemented in Python and demonstrate various programming concepts and problem-solving approaches.

## Problem Solutions

### Problem 1: Calculator
**File:** [`Problem-1.py`](./Problem-1.py)

A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The calculator takes two double values and an operation type as input and returns the result of the specified operation.

### Problem 2: Odd Number Series Generator
**File:** [`Problem-2.py`](./Problem-2.py)

Generates a series of odd numbers based on the input value:
- Input: A single integer 'a'
- Output: A series of odd numbers from 1 up to (2a-1)

Example:
- Input: 4
- Output: 1, 3, 5, 7

### Problem 3: Modified Odd Number Series Generator
**File:** [`Problem-3.py`](./Problem-3.py)

Generates a modified series of odd numbers based on the input value:
- Input: A single integer 'a'
- Output: A series of odd numbers with special handling for even inputs

Example:
- Input: 5
- Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Input: 6
- Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

### Problem 4: Multiple Counter
**File:** [`Problem-4.py`](./Problem-4.py)

Counts the number of elements in a list that are multiples of numbers from 1 to 9:
- Input: A list of numbers
- Output: A dictionary showing the count of numbers divisible by each number from 1 to 9

Example:
- Input: [1,2,8,9,12,46,76,82,15,20,30]
- Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}

## How to Run
